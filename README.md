### About Cyclistic

Cyclistic, established in 2016, operates a successful bike-share program in Chicago with 5,824 geotracked bicycles across 692 stations. The company offers flexible pricing plans including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, with a strategic focus on converting casual riders into more profitable annual members. Understanding the behavioral differences between these customer segments and leveraging digital media for targeted marketing are critical objectives identified by Cyclistic's marketing team led by Moreno. Analysis of historical bike trip data will inform data-driven strategies aimed at increasing annual memberships and driving future growth.

### Business Objectives

1. Understand the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders with Cyclistic bikes.
2. Identify motivations for casual riders to purchase Cyclistic annual memberships.
3. Develop strategies utilizing digital media to encourage casual riders to transition into annual members at Cyclistic.

### Analysis Structure

To analyze Cyclistic trip data and gain insights into how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, these are the steps I will take:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Gather and clean the Cyclistic trip data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
   - Organize the data by distinguishing between trips made by casual riders and trips made by annual members.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   Conduct descriptive statistics:
     - Calculate and compare average ride duration for casual riders and annual members.
     - Analyze frequency of rides per day, week, or month for each group.
     - Identify peak usage times and popular routes/stations used by each segment.
     - Explore any seasonal or time-of-day patterns in bike usage.
   
3. **Visualization:**
   Create visualizations such as:
     - Visualize distributions of ride durations for annual members and casual riders (e.g., histograms, box plots).
     - Present trends in ride frequency over time (e.g., line graphs).
     - Map out popular routes and station preferences for each user type (e.g., heatmaps, geographical plots).
   
4. **Statistical Analysis:**
   Perform statistical tests (maybe):
     - Conduct t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests to compare average ride durations between casual riders and annual members.
     - Use chi-square tests to analyze differences in categorical variables such as station preferences or route choices.
   
5. **Insights Generation:**
   Derive actionable insights from the analysis:
     - Identify patterns that distinguish how casual riders and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes.
     - Determine if there are significant differences in usage behaviors, such as commute patterns, weekend vs. weekday usage, or seasonal variations.
     - Explore potential reasons behind these usage differences (e.g., convenience, cost-effectiveness, loyalty benefits).
